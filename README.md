# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project
This project applies SQL to explore global COVID-19 data, focusing on key metrics such as confirmed cases, death counts, and vaccination rates. The analysis leverages advanced SQL techniques, including joins, common table expressions (CTEs), window functions, and aggregate calculations, to uncover patterns and trends. Insights from the data are presented to understand the pandemic's progression across regions, identify hotspots, and evaluate vaccination efforts. The code provides a practical demonstration of SQL's power in analyzing large datasets and extracting actionable information.
