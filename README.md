# Covid-DataExploration-SQL
This project utilizes SQL to analyze global pandemic data, focusing on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates. By employing SQL techniques such as joins, common table expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, window functions, and aggregate functions, the analysis provides insights into infection trends, mortality rates, and vaccination progress across different countries and continents. This comprehensive exploration aids in understanding the pandemic's impact and supports data-driven decision-making.
